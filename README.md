### Unpublished games in Ruby
**Ruby** is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. Developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the mid-1990s, Ruby emphasizes a clean and readable syntax that allows developers to write code that is both elegant and easy to understand. Its object-oriented nature means that everything in Ruby, including numbers and classes, is an object, which promotes a consistent and intuitive programming model. Ruby supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional and imperative programming, and is highly extensible with a rich set of libraries and frameworks. It is particularly famous for its use in web development through the Ruby on Rails framework, which streamlines the development of web applications with convention-over-configuration principles. Rubyâ€™s focus on developer happiness and its vibrant community contribute to its reputation as a language that enhances productivity and ease of use.
